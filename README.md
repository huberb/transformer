This is my personal quest to understand transformers.

More specificially, I'd like to understand their application in image recognition and image generation tasks. For this, we will need to visit the "Attention is all you need" Paper. Later I'll try to apply what I've learned on an implementation of "A Picture if worth 16x16 words". Since this is supposed to be educational and there's a chance I'll use this in presentations, I'll do it in a Google Colab Notebook.
